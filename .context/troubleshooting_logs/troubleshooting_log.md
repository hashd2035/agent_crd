**Summary of Attempts and Lessons Learned (Step 1 and Start of Step 2)**

**Initial Setup & Core Functionality:**

*   **Goal:** Create a basic CRD and operator that can create and delete pods.
*   **Outcome:** Successfully created a basic operator that could create and delete pods, and set up a basic test framework.
*   **Lesson:** The core functionality of the operator was working, but there were issues with status updates and test cases.

**Status Update Issues:**

*   **Problem:** The `create_agent` handler's return value (`pod_name`) was automatically merged into the `status`.
*   **Attempts:**
    *   Removed the `return` statement: Did not prevent `kopf` from merging the result.
    *   Patched the status with `None`: `kopf` overwrites the patched value.
    *   Set the full status with correct values: Did not prevent `kopf` from adding the `pod_name`.
    *   Used `field_manager='kopf'` in patching: Did not prevent `kopf` from merging the return value.
    *   Used `kopf.StatusProgressStorage`: Did not prevent `kopf` from merging the return value.
    *   Corrected `kopf.configure` call: Fixed a `TypeError` but did not fix the status issue.
*   **Lessons:**
    *   `kopf` automatically merges handler results into the status.
    *   `kopf` tracks the last-handled configuration in annotations.
    *   Patching the status does not prevent merging.
    *   `kopf.StatusProgressStorage` controls where progress data is stored, not how the status is updated.
    *   I was misinterpreting the documentation and using the `kopf.configure` incorrectly.
*   **Decision:** I decided to stop trying to remove `create_agent.pod_name` from the status and focus on the core functionality.

**Test Case Issues:**

*   **Problem:** The initial tests were not comprehensive enough, and I was not implementing the tests correctly.
*   **Attempts:**
    *   Fixed `test_invalid_configuration` to correctly assert the error message.
    *   Fixed `test_delete_agent` to properly wait for resource deletion.
    *   Added new tests for volume creation, init container execution, and wrapper injection.
    *   Fixed test setup to prevent `409 Conflict` errors.
*   **Lessons:**
    *   Test cases should be comprehensive and verify both happy and unhappy paths.
    *   Test cases should be implemented correctly and should assert the correct values.
    *   Test cases should clean up resources after testing.
    *   I was not following TDD principles correctly, and I was not letting the tests fail first.
*   **Decision:** I have implemented the test cases to cover all the required functionality, and I have also fixed the test setup to prevent errors.

**Other Issues:**

*   **Operator Logs Missing:** Fixed by using the correct pod name in the `kubectl logs` command.
*   **Scope Creep:** I was trying to implement more than required, and I was also trying to fix things that were not required.
*   **Monolithic Code:** I was trying to implement everything in `operator/main.py`, and I was not thinking about modularity.
*   **Not Following Plan:** I was not following the `implementation_details.md` and `comprehensive_plan.md` correctly, and I was jumping to different steps without completing the previous ones.

**Overall Lessons Learned:**

*   **Read the Documentation:** I need to read the documentation more carefully and understand the framework's intended behavior before implementing any code.
*   **Incremental Approach:** I need to implement changes incrementally, testing each step thoroughly.
*   **Test-Driven Development:** I need to write tests first and let them fail, and then implement the code to make them pass.
*   **Track Progress:** I need to track my thought process, assumptions, and code changes, so that I can learn from my mistakes.
*  **Seek Help**: I should ask for help from others and consult the documentation when I am stuck.

**Current Status:**

*   The core functionality of the operator is working.
*   The status updates are working, but I cannot prevent `kopf` from adding the `create_agent.pod_name` field.
*   The tests for volume creation, init container execution, and wrapper injection are failing, as expected.

I am now ready to move on to **Step 2.4. Shared Volume** and start implementing the code for that.

I will not make any further changes to the `kopf.configure` function or try to remove the `create_agent.pod_name` from the status.
