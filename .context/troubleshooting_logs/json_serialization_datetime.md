# Current Issues:



1. Error: "Object of type datetime is not JSON serializable"

```
[2025-01-09 09:42:54,637] kopf.objects         [ERROR   ] Error creating agent pod: Object of type datetime is not JSON serializable
[2025-01-09 09:42:54,638] kopf.objects         [ERROR   ] Handler 'create_agent' failed permanently: Failed to create agent pod: Object of type datetime is not JSON serializable
```

2. This error occurs after pod creation succeeds
3. The error prevents the operator from properly handling the AgentType resource
4. The error appears to be related to kopf's handling of the return value/status

# Severity Assessment:
1. Impact Level: Low
   - Core pod creation and management functionality works correctly
   - Pods are being created and managed as expected
   - Error occurs only in status/return handling

2. Workaround Status:
   - No workaround needed for MVP
   - Does not affect main functionality
   - May need investigation when implementing advanced status reporting

# Initial Debugging Attempt:
1. Added extensive logging throughout the pod creation process
2. Added logging for pod spec, raw dict, API response
3. These logs helped identify that pod creation was successful

# Log Removal Attempt:
1. Thought the logs might be part of what's being serialized
2. Removed most debug logs
3. This didn't solve the issue and made debugging harder
Return Value Modification:
```
return {
    'pod_name': created_pod.metadata.name,
    'namespace': created_pod.metadata.namespace,
    'uid': created_pod.metadata.uid
}
```
Datetime Format Changes:
```
# First try
'lastTransitionTime': datetime.datetime.utcnow().isoformat() + "Z"

# Second try
'lastTransitionTime': datetime.now(timezone.utc).isoformat().replace('+00:00', 'Z')

# Third try
'lastTransitionTime': datetime.datetime.now(timezone.utc).strftime('%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ')
```
String Conversion Attempt:
```
return {
    'pod_name': str(created_pod.metadata.name),
    'namespace': str(created_pod.metadata.namespace),
    'uid': str(created_pod.metadata.uid),
    'status': 'created'
}
```

# Key Learning Points:
1. Removing logs was counterproductive - they were valuable for debugging
2. The error occurs after successful pod creation
3. We haven't properly identified what kopf is trying to serialize

# Decision:
- Proceeding with MVP development
- Will revisit when implementing advanced status reporting features
- Core functionality not impacted enough to block progress
