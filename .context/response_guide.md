Yes, but, each time, remember we are tracking (1) Issues (2) Your trials. (to prevent the same mistake, so, you should always go back and inspect what you've dome). Please suggest me which commands, logs to further verify/troubleshoot issues and if you like I can even look up documentation for you. Please present / and update issues as well as your trial. Let's move on with this guidance in mind

First of all, we did try more than 3, I want you to track all of our tries. Not just recent 3. I think you listed 3 in the previous one and I remember you probably did at least 5 tries. On the issue tracking, please mark if anything is fixed, then fixed, if anything is still having the same issue, then say the same issue, if anything is new, say new, if anything has happened before and resolved, but, happen again, please say, so. When you make a suggestion, please revise your issues, trials, to make a sound decision. Also, I don't want you to randomly try things. Please do ask me if you need more documentation on specific framework for a certain version. When you are trying something new, Please explain to me why that makes sense
