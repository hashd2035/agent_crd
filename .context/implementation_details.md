# Guide
- We are adhering to the plan presented in comprehensive_plan.md
- We want it to be as small and essential as possible.
- We are adhering to the scope and do not expand scope without necessary needs. 
- We build on top of the previous implementation. We do not replace whole things, ignoring the previous implementation.
- We inspect and justify if we need to change the structure.
- Always present the folder structure before we start each section and when refering a file, always refer to the full path.
- Always inspect if the implementation adhere to comprehensive_plan.md
- If we need to change the architecture, reflect if this is really needed. Always remember changing architecture is costly
- If changing the architecture, rewrite the comprehensive_plan.md again and present this at once. I want a single source of truth, not the ideas scattered around

For each section on implementation
1. First confirm the folder structure from our plan 
2. Then implement each file with absolute paths
3. Keep it minimal and follow our plans exactly
4. Explain how it aligns with our plan
5. Note which test scenario it supports
